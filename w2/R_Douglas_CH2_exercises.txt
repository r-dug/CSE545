2.3 For each of the following assertions, say whether it is true or false and support your
answer with examples or counterexamples where appropriate.
a. An agent that senses only partial information about the state cannot be perfectly rational.



b. There exist task environments in which no pure reflex agent can behave rationally.



c. There exists a task environment in which every agent is rational.



d. The input to an agent program is the same as the input to the agent function.


2.5 Define in your own words the following terms: agent, agent function, agent program,
rationality, autonomy, reflex agent, model-based agent, goal-based agent, utility-based agent,
learning agent.



2.6 This exercise explores the differences between agent functions and agent programs.
a. Can there be more than one agent program that implements a given agent function?
Give an example, or show why one is not possible.



b. Are there agent functions that cannot be implemented by any agent program?



c. Given a fixed machine architecture, does each agent program implement exactly one
agent function?



d. Given an architecture with n bits of storage, how many different possible agent programs are there?
